          <blockquote>
            "[…] the difference between you and a zoologist or you and a botanist is that the botanist, when she looks at a flower, has a question in mind. She's trying to generate questions. For her the flower is the locus of many mental threads, some nascent, some spanning her career. […] That's the promise: you will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it."
