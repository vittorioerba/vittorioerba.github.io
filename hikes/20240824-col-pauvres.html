    We enjoyed the path from Pont de Nant to Euzanne, it passes through a thick and peaceful forest with green moss.
    <br><br>
    From Euzanne one climbs up through a cow field where the path is not always evident, but that is not a problem as the direction to follow is clear, and when the hill becomes steeper the path is well traced again.
    Towards the Col the path is steep and very enjoyable, the trees leaving space to weird rock formations. 
    <br><br>
    The Col has a full stunning view on the Grand Mauveran massif, with the Petit Mauveran in the center. On the other side, a view on the valley, looking towards the lake and the Cornette de Bise.
    <br><br>
    Right after the Col, the hiking path becomes somewhat more challening for a couple hundred meters (on the map, this is where the path passes through the cliffs): the path is quite vertiginous, it is narrow, it has a steep (and sometimes vertical) cliff on the South side, and the terrain is dry earth (so not super stable).
    We found it totally doable in good weather with dry terrain, but would strongly advise against doing it with rain/snow or to people scared by the void.
    <br><br>
    From the steep part right after the Col down to Nant the hiking path is wide and easy, crossing the beautiful valley and following the river (which seems a nice spot to take a refreshing swim).
    We took the trace on the South-East side of the river up to Nant, it was not very clear where to cross the river, but the terrain is easy enough to be able to find the trace back on the other side.
    If the river is very full, the crossing may be tricky.
    <br><br>
    We will surely come back, the ridge going from Pont de Nant up to the Col des Martinets, passing thorugh the Pointe des Martinets seems gorgeous and <a href="https://sommets.ch/excursions/details/pointe_des_martinets_par_aretes_et_vires/">doable</a>.
